#### Quick Overflow is a chrome extension which helps you quickly find, understand, and solve your javascript errors. 
Every time Quick Overflow detects an error in your javascript, it embeds an "error module" at the top of your webpage. 

This module contains: 
* an explanation of your error 
* the code that caused it
* a one-click Stack Overflow search for relevant solutions.

The extension can listen for errors on any website, but can also be easily disabled for when you want to browse the web in peace.

Download the test webpage [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noamhacker/quick-overflow/master/test-errors.html) (save it as a .html file, and open it in chrome).

Make sure to enable the extension by clicking the icon. Visit chrome://extensions to "Allow access to file URLs" - this allows the extension to listen for errors when you are developing locally.
