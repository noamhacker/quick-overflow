# Quick Overflow
#### Quick Overflow is a chrome extension which helps you quickly understand and solve your javascript errors. 
Every time Quick Overflow detects an error in your javascript, it embeds an "error module" at the top of your webpage. 
This module contains an explanation of your error, the code that caused it, and a one-click Stack Overflow search for relevant solutions.
The extension can listen for errors on any website, but can also be easily disabled for when you want to browse the web in peace.
